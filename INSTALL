1) Install the RPM for your platform.

2) Make sure rpcbind is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable rpcbind.service
           systemctl start rpcbind.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable rpcbind
           service rpcbind start

   NOTE: rpcbind should be running with "-i" as an argument.  This is set
   in /etc/sysconfig/rpcbind by the RPM %post scriptlet.

3) Make sure xinetd is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable xinetd.service
           systemctl start xinetd.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable xinetd
           service xinetd start

4) You probably want to disable the firewall or figure out which ports to
   poke holes for.

5) To avoid RPC related errors, also had to run:
       Centos 7.3:
           sudo systemctl add-wants multi-user.target rpcbind
